FCP - lipid interactions for P. tricornutum and C. gracilis FCPs.
The residence time of lipids around the FCP complexes are mapped
onto the B-factor column of pdb files. High "B-factor" values
indicate strong interaction with thylakoid lipids.

The work on FCP -lipid interactions for P. tricornutum and C. Gracilis is funded by the Hellenic Foundation for Research & Innovation (H.F.R.I) in the context of the call “Basic Research Financing (Horizontal support for all Sciences), National Recovery and Resilience Plan (Greece 2.0) for the project number 014775, with acronym “SUNDIAL”.
