FCP - lipid interactions for P. tricornutum and C. gracilis FCPs.
The residence time of lipids around the FCP complexes are mapped
onto the B-factor column of pdb files. High "B-factor" values
indicate strong interaction with thylakoid lipids.

The pdb files were generated by PyLipID (J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2022, 18, 2, 1188–1201),
a specialized Python package designed to analyze protein–lipid interactions from molecular
dynamics simulations. All trajectory data from:
Commun Chem 8, 392 (2025). https://doi.org/10.1038/s42004-025-01774-x
were used for the PyLipID analysis, the topology file used for each system included the FCP
polypeptide and the thylakoid lipids. For each thylakoid lipid type, PyLipID generated a
separate pdb file in which the B-factors encode the residence time of each lipid on specific
residues. All resulting pdb files were then collected, and the B-factors were combined and
normalized on a scale from 0 to 10.

The work on FCP -lipid interactions for P. tricornutum and C. Gracilis is funded by the Hellenic
Foundation for Research & Innovation (H.F.R.I) in the context of the call “Basic Research Financing
(Horizontal support for all Sciences), National Recovery and Resilience Plan (Greece 2.0) for the
project number 014775, with acronym “SUNDIAL”.
